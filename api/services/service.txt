Services - Thought Process
--------------------------
How service flow to be structured

1. Input Validator - take json / data input and rule basic data validation as required by the service
2. Initial Use Case(s) - call use case interfaces
3. Repo Calls - call database actions
4. After Repo Use Cases - any other use case which needs to be run before - call it now
5. Output - Return back - prepare the return data-packet for the frontend

// end
